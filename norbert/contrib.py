    Parameters
    ----------
    v : ndarray, shape=(..., nb_sources)
        non-negative data on which to apply interference reduction
    thresh : float
        threshold for the compression, should be between 0 and 1. The closer

        the slope at which binarization is done. The higher, the more brutal

    Parameters
    ----------
    W : ndarray, arbitrary shape
        filter on which to apply logit compression. if `multichannel` is False,
        it should be real values between 0 and 1.
    thresh : float
        threshold for the compression, should be between 0 and 1. The closer

    slope : float
        the slope at which binarization is done. The higher, the more brutal
    multichannel : boolean
        indicate whether we decompose the filter as a beamforming and single
        channel part. In such a case, filter must be of shape
